## Installation

1. Install Latest QtCreator
2. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Make sure to review the system requirements before installation.
3. Install a language models in Ollama via terminal. For example, you can run:

For standard computers (minimum 8GB RAM):
```
ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b
```
For better performance (16GB+ RAM):
```
ollama run qwen2.5-coder:14b
```
For high-end systems (32GB+ RAM):
```
ollama run qwen2.5-coder:32b
```
4. Download the QodeAssist plugin for your QtCreator.
5. Launch Qt Creator and install the plugin:
   - Go to MacOS: Qt Creator -> About Plugins...
           Windows\Linux: Help -> About Plugins...
   - Click on "Install Plugin..."
   - Select the downloaded QodeAssist plugin archive file

## Configure Plugin

QodeAssist comes with default settings that should work immediately after installing a language model. The plugin is pre-configured to use Ollama with standard templates, so you may only need to verify the settings.

1. Open Qt Creator settings (Edit > Preferences on Linux/Windows, Qt Creator > Preferences on macOS)
2. Navigate to the "Qode Assist" tab
3. On the "General" page, verify:
    - Ollama is selected as your LLM provider
    - The URL is set to http://localhost:11434
    - Your installed model appears in the model selection
    - The prompt template is Ollama Auto FIM
4. Click Apply if you made any changes

You're all set! QodeAssist is now ready to use in Qt Creator.

## Supported LLM Providers
QodeAssist currently supports the following LLM (Large Language Model) providers:
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com)

## Recommended Models:
QodeAssist has been thoroughly tested and optimized for use with the following language models:

- Qwen2.5-coder
- CodeLlama
- StarCoder2
- DeepSeek-Coder-V2

### Ollama:
### For autocomplete(FIM)
```
ollama run codellama:7b-code
ollama run starcoder2:7b
ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b-base
ollama run deepseek-coder-v2:16b-lite-base-q3_K_M
```
### For chat
```
ollama run codellama:7b-instruct
ollama run starcoder2:instruct
ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct
ollama run deepseek-coder-v2
```

### Template-Model Compatibility

| Template | Compatible Models | Purpose |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| CodeLlama FIM | `codellama:code` | Code completion |
| DeepSeekCoder FIM | `deepseek-coder-v2`, `deepseek-v2.5` | Code completion |
| Ollama Auto FIM | `Any Ollama base model` | Code completion |
| Qwen FIM | `Qwen 2.5 models` | Code completion |
| StarCoder2 FIM | `starcoder2 base model` | Code completion |

## Troubleshooting

If QodeAssist is having problems connecting to the LLM provider, please check the following:

1. Verify the IP address and port:

    - For Ollama, the default is usually http://localhost:11434
    - For LM Studio, the default is usually http://localhost:1234

2. Check the endpoint:

Make sure the endpoint in the settings matches the one required by your provider
    - For Ollama, it should be /api/generate
    - For LM Studio and OpenAI compatible providers, it's usually /v1/chat/completions

3. Confirm that the selected model and template are compatible:

Ensure you've chosen the correct model in the "Select Models" option
Verify that the selected prompt template matches the model you're using

If you're still experiencing issues with QodeAssist, you can try resetting the settings to their default values:
1. Open Qt Creator settings
2. Navigate to the "Qode Assist" tab
3. Pick settings page for reset
4. Click on the "Reset Page to Defaults" button
    - The API key will not reset
    - Select model after reset

## How to Build

Create a build directory and run

    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path_to_qtcreator> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo <path_to_plugin_source>
    cmake --build .

where `<path_to_qtcreator>` is the relative or absolute path to a Qt Creator build directory, or to a
combined binary and development package (Windows / Linux), or to the `Qt Creator.app/Contents/Resources/`
directory of a combined binary and development package (macOS), and `<path_to_plugin_source>` is the
relative or absolute path to this plugin directory.
