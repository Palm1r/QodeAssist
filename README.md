## System Prompt Configuration

The plugin comes with default system prompts optimized for chat and instruct models, as these currently provide better results for code assistance. If you prefer using FIM (Fill-in-Middle) models, you can easily customize the system prompt in the settings.

## File Context Features

QodeAssist provides two powerful ways to include source code files in your chat conversations: Attachments and Linked Files. Each serves a distinct purpose and helps provide better context for the AI assistant.

### Attached Files

Attachments are designed for one-time code analysis and specific queries:
  - Files are included only in the current message
  - Content is discarded after the message is processed
  - Ideal for:
    - Getting specific feedback on code changes
    - Code review requests
    - Analyzing isolated code segments
    - Quick implementation questions
  - Files can be attached using the paperclip icon in the chat interface
  - Multiple files can be attached to a single message

### Linked Files

Linked files provide persistent context throughout the conversation:

  - Files remain accessible for the entire chat session
  - Content is included in every message exchange
  - Files are automatically refreshed - always using latest content from disk
  - Perfect for:
    - Long-term refactoring discussions
    - Complex architectural changes
    - Multi-file implementations
    - Maintaining context across related questions
  - Can be managed using the link icon in the chat interface
  - Supports automatic syncing with open editor files (can be enabled in settings)
  - Files can be added/removed at any time during the conversation

## Hotkeys

- To call manual request to suggestion, you can use or change it in settings
    - on Mac: Option + Command + Q
    - on Windows: Ctrl + Alt + Q
    - on Linux with KDE Plasma: Ctrl + Alt + Q
- To insert the full suggestion, you can use the TAB key
- To insert word of suggistion, you can use Alt + Right Arrow for Win/Lin, or Option + Right Arrow for Mac
    
## Troubleshooting

If QodeAssist is having problems connecting to the LLM provider, please check the following:

1. Verify the IP address and port:

    - For Ollama, the default is usually http://localhost:11434
    - For LM Studio, the default is usually http://localhost:1234

2. Confirm that the selected model and template are compatible:

    Ensure you've chosen the correct model in the "Select Models" option
    Verify that the selected prompt template matches the model you're using

3. On Linux the prebuilt binaries support only ubuntu 22.04+ or simililliar os. 
If you need compatiblity with another os, you have to build manualy. our experiments and resolution you can check here: https://github.com/Palm1r/QodeAssist/issues/48

If you're still experiencing issues with QodeAssist, you can try resetting the settings to their default values:
1. Open Qt Creator settings
2. Navigate to the "QodeAssist" tab
3. Pick settings page for reset
4. Click on the "Reset Page to Defaults" button
    - The API key will not reset
    - Select model after reset

## How to Build

Create a build directory and run

    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path_to_qtcreator> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo <path_to_plugin_source>
    cmake --build .

where `<path_to_qtcreator>` is the relative or absolute path to a Qt Creator build directory, or to a
combined binary and development package (Windows / Linux), or to the `Qt Creator.app/Contents/Resources/`
directory of a combined binary and development package (macOS), and `<path_to_plugin_source>` is the
relative or absolute path to this plugin directory.
